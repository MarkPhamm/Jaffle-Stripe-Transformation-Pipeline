# Jaffle Stripe Transformation Pipeline

A modern data transformation pipeline that integrates and transforms sample data from **Jaffle Shop** (a fictional e-commerce dataset) and **Stripe** (payment processing data) for analytics. Built with ❤️ using `dbt` (data build tool).

---

## 📖 Overview

This pipeline demonstrates how to:
1. **Extract** raw transactional data from Jaffle Shop (sample e-commerce data) and Stripe (payment gateway).
2. **Transform** the data into clean, analysis-ready datasets (e.g., customer lifetime value, payment analytics).
3. **Load** structured data into a data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift).

Ideal for learning data transformation patterns, idempotent modeling, and data quality testing with `dbt`.

---

## ✨ Features

- **End-to-End Data Pipeline**: From raw source data to analytics-ready tables.
- **Modular Data Models**: Staging, intermediate, and mart layers for scalable transformations.
- **Data Quality Checks**: Built-in `dbt` tests for freshness, uniqueness, and validity.
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated docs for tables, columns, and lineage.
- **Sample Datasets**:
  - `jaffle_shop`: Mock customer/order data.
  - `stripe`: Payment and subscription events.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- `dbt-core` and adapter (e.g., `dbt-bigquery`, `dbt-snowflake`)
- A data warehouse (BigQuery, Snowflake, etc.)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MarkPhamm/Jaffle-Stripe-Transformation-Pipeline.git
   cd Jaffle-Stripe-Transformation-Pipeline
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # if applicable
   ```

3. **Set up your data warehouse** and configure `profiles.yml` for `dbt` ([dbt profile setup guide](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform)).

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. **Configure Data Sources**:
   - **Jaffle Shop**: Sample data included as CSV files (loaded via `dbt seed`).
   - **Stripe**: Set up Stripe API credentials in `stripe.yml` or environment variables.

2. **Update `dbt_project.yml`**:
   - Adjust database/schema names and materialization settings.

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Load seed data (Jaffle Shop)**:
   ```bash
   dbt seed
   ```

2. **Run transformations**:
   ```bash
   dbt run
   ```

3. **Test data quality**:
   ```bash
   dbt test
   ```

4. **Generate documentation**:
   ```bash
   dbt docs generate
   dbt docs serve  # View at http://localhost:8080
   ```
